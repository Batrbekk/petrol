Wherever there is a person, there are everyday difficulties. Our ancestors praised unity, honesty, and solidarity in difficult times. It was especially valued when the interests of society were placed above personal ones and what one had was shared. In this regard, one of the companies that made a significant contribution to the socio-economic development not only of the Kyzylorda region but also of the country, JSC \"TURGAY-PETROLEUM,\" provided charitable assistance to low-income families in the socially vulnerable groups of the city of Kyzylorda and distributed food baskets.",
        "This charitable assistance was initiated by the company's General Director, Dauren Abilkhairov. He was also supported by members of the 'Amanat' party and specialists from the Kyzylorda city branch of the Department of Employment and Social Programs.",
        "I wish success to such a generous person as you, who is a guardian for those in need of care, gives kind words and warmth of heart, spreads the light of goodness, provides sponsorship assistance, and I wish your family well-being and success! As the proverb says, 'The earth turns green from rain, and the country flourishes from good deeds,' I wish you to remain in the light of the people's gratitude!‚Äù - expressed gratitude from one of the residents of Tasboget who received this assistance."
